Duplicate Tab Hotkey
====================

This is an Add-on for Firefox.

The files of this addon are licensed under the
[MPL 2.0](http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/).

If enabled, a keyboard shortcut for duplicating
the current tab will be bound to `Accel+K`.
Since this conflicts with one of the shortcuts
for the Search Bar, an alternate shortcut like
`Ctrl+J` should be used for this purpose.
